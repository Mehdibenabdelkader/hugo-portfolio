I’m driven by curiosity — the kind that doesn’t settle for just knowing how something works, but why it works, and how it could work better.

That mindset has taken me across a wide range of roles: building network infrastructures, developing and designing full-stack applications, automating complex tasks, and even mentoring students on their first lines of code. I didn’t follow a narrow path — I followed questions. 

This flexibility isn’t random — it’s the result of a constant drive to explore, adapt, and deliver value wherever it’s needed most.

I’m not limited by job titles or tech stacks. I’m guided by the problem — and the curiosity to solve it.
