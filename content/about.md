Iâ€™m an aspiring Network, Systems, and Security Engineer with hands-on experience at a national ISP, passionate about IT and Computer Science.

A naturally curious mind, I'm a firm believer that the best way to understand how something works is to break it, and try to put it back together again. I enjoy learning about new topics, building things, and connecting ideas across different fields.

Besides Network engineering, I am interested in Design, Game Development and Tech in general.

If I am not by my desk, I am probably out chasing sunrises and sunsets.
